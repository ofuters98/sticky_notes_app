HTTP apps use a mix of cookies, sessions, tokens, local storage and some other methods in order to preserve the state of an application across several request-response cycles. The choice of method is dependent on specific requirements for that app, such as scalability or security. 
Sessions is where data is stored on the server side. The data is associated with a unique session ID. The server uses this session ID to retrieve and the stored data and keep its state across requests.
Tokens can also be used to preserve the state of an app across multiple request-response cycles. Tokens are often used for authentication purposes. When a user logs in, a server generates a token and sends it to the client. The client includes this token in later requests. This allows the server to verify the token and as a result authenticate the user.

In order to perform a database migration to a server-based database like MariaDB, you would do the following:
1. Make sure you have the right connector installed in your virtual environment as well as MariaDB itself.
2. Login in the MariaDB server and create a new database and user for your project.
3. Update your Django project settings. In the DATABASES section it should look something like:
* ‘default’: {
‘ENGINE’ : ‘django.db.backends.mysql’,
‘NAME’ : ‘django_db’
‘USER’ : ‘django_user’
‘PASSWORD’ : ‘your_password’
‘HOST’ : ‘localhost’,
‘PORT’: ‘3306’,
}
4. Make migrations as normal.
